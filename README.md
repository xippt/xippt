As a graduate student, I am currently focusing on research and practice in the fields of artificial intelligence and big data analysis. In my spare time, I actively participate in various technology projects, particularly those that combine cutting-edge algorithms with practical application scenarios. Through continuous learning and practice, I have become proficient in Python, Java,Cuda C++ and other mainstream programming languages. I also possess a deep understanding of data structures, algorithm optimization, and system design. Additionally, I regularly participate in open-source projects, collaborating with teams to drive technological innovation.
